# Schedulo

This is an AI-Powered Timetable Scheduling application built with Next.js and Genkit, created in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally, you will need to start two separate development servers.

### 1. Run the Web Application

In your first terminal, run the following command to start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 2. Run the AI Flows

In a second terminal, run the following command to start the Genkit development server. This allows the AI features to function correctly.

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

Now, both the frontend application and the AI backend are running, and you can use all the features of the app.
